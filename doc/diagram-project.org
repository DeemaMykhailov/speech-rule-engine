Notes from the Diagram project

* Refactoring the tree generation.

** Separate out into three types of methods:

*** MathML parsing with parseXYZ
*** Semantic Node processing with processXYZ
*** Semantic Node building with makeXYZ

** Factory, Parser and Processor

*** Factory contains a counter a limited number of methods.

*** Processor is a singleton with a factory

*** Parser is a singleton with a factory

*** Each tree contains its factory.
